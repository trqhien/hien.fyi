I am a seasoned technology leader by day and an indie software engineer by night. I have led the development of widely-used applications, serving millions of users across multiple countries. Throughout my career, I have assisted organizations and teams in reaching their business goals by designing adaptable, maintainable architectures tailored to their specific needs and team sizes. I am committed to enhancing team efficiency through optimized workflows and an improved developer experience. Additionally, I excel at bridging cross-functional collaboration gaps, coordinating and facilitating long-term strategic planning, and executing comprehensive initiatives as needed.
