## The problem

Enums, along with classes and structs, play a crucial role in structuring your Swift code, allowing you to define data models and behaviors in a clean, organized, and type-safe manner. However, enums, perhaps Appleâ€™s least favorite child, still havenâ€™t received the attention they deserve. Compared to their siblings, enums lack some great features that structs and classes get for free.

One particular feature that we'll focus on today is [KeyPath](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/expressions/#Key-Path-Expression), a powerful feature that only available for struct and class. Every field on struct or class gets a free key path denoted by a backslash syntax

```swift
struct Employee {
    let name: String
    var age: Int
    var address: Address
}

struct Address {
  var city: String
  var country: String
}

\Employee.name\ // KeyPath<Employee, String>
\Employee.address.city // WritableKeyPath<User, Int>

let employee = Employee(name: "Blob", age: 28, address: Address(city: "Ho Chi Minh", country: "Vietnam"))
employee[keyPath: \.name] // Blob
employee[keyPath: \.address.city] = "Manila"
```

Enums lack the ergonomic ability to drill down and access data. The Swift API provides only two ways to work with enums: `switch` and `case let`, both of which require a lot of boilerplate code just to access the associated data within an enum.

```swift
enum SubscriptionType {
    case pro(renewal: Date)
    case free
}

var subsription: SubscriptionType

...

if case let .pro(renewalDated) = subscription else {
    print(renewalDated)
}

// or

switch subscription {
case let .pro(renewalDated):
    print(renewalDated)
default: 
    break
}
```

The situation becomes even more cumbersome when dealing with nested enums. For example

```swift
enum LoadingStatus {
    case idle
    case loading
    case loaded(SubscriptionType)
    case failure(Error)
}
```

## Introducing CasePath

So, is it possible for enums to have the same features as their siblings? Wouldn't it be nice to do this instead of `switch` or `case let` ?

```swift
subscription[keyPath: \.pro.renewalDate] 
loadingStatus[keyPath: \.loaded.pro.renewalDate]
```

While researching this problem, I came across the [swift-case-paths](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths) package developed by the PointFree team and instantly fell in love with it. Iâ€™ve been using it in all my projects ever since. So the PointFree team introduced a new concept called `CasePath`. Simply put, case paths are key paths, but for enums.

All you have to do is to annotate your enum with `@CasePathable` macro. The Swift Syntax will generate the necessary boilerplate that allows you to drill down to an enumâ€™s associated type as if it were a key path.

```swift
@CasePathable
enum SubscriptionType {
    ...
}

@CasePathable
enum LoadingStatus {
    ...
}

var loadingStatus = LoadingStatus.loaded(.pro(renewal: Date(...)))

loadingStatuss[case: \.loaded.pro] // Date?
```

You can also do case matching

```swift
let subscription = SubscriptionType.free
        
subscription.is(\.free) // true
subscription.is(\.pro) // false
```

Or mutate the associated value

```swift
func renewPro() {
    subscription.modify(\.pro) {
        $0.addTimeInterval(365 * 24 * 60 * 60)
    }
}
```

## Struct dot chaining syntax for enum

Recall how easy it is to access the data inside a struct or class using the dot syntax.

```swift
employee.name
employee.address.country
```

CasePath has you coveredâ€”you can use `@CasePathable` together with `@dynamicMemberLookup` to enable dot-chaining syntax for enums. How neat! ðŸ™Œ

```swift
struct User {
    let username: String
    let subscriptionType: SubscriptionType
}
    
@CasePathable
@dynamicMemberLookup
enum SubscriptionType {
    ...
}

let blob = User(username: "Blob", subscriptionType: .free)
let klob = User(username: "Klob", subscriptionType: .pro(renewal: Date(...))

blob.subscriptionType.pro // nil
blob.subscriptionType.pro // Date(...)
```

Moreover, this also enables key path expressions for enum case. Now it can be use in function that accepts key path

```swift
let users: [User] = [...]
let renewalDates = users.compactMap(\.subscriptionType.pro) // [Date]
let renewalDates = users.map(\.subscriptionType.pro) // [Date?]
```

## Final words

CasePath unlocks even more power from enums. The PointFree team has been leveraging CasePath in their other open-source projects, such as [Composable Architecture](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) and [SwiftUI Navigation](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swiftui-navigation). It greatly helps in making our code more readable and ergonomic. This article just scratches the surface. Since Iâ€™ve been intensively using CasePath in many of my projects, Iâ€™ve created a lot of utilities around it. Weâ€™ll discuss this more in a future article.
